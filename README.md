### **N-Queens Puzzle Game: A Strategic Challenge**

The N-Queens Puzzle is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, inviting players to test their strategic thinking and logical prowess. Your goal is simple yet challenging: place **N queens** on an **N×N chessboard** so that no two queens threaten each other.

In chess, a queen is a powerful piece, capable of attacking horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

The puzzle requires you to find a configuration where every queen is safe from every other queen.
